  <h4>Time to Live (TTL)</h4>
    <p>The TTL dictates the lifespan of a DNS record; a shorter time means less time to wait until the changes go into effect. TTLs are always set in seconds with a few common ones being 86400 (24 hours),  43200 (12 hours), and 3600 (1 hour).</p>
    <p>When you make a change to the TTL of an existing record, you need to wait for the old TTL time to pass - that is, if it had been set to 86400, you would need to wait a full 24 hours for the new setting to be in place everywhere.</p>
